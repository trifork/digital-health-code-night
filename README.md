# Digital Health code-night examples

This Github repository is an example repository for showing how you can start working with Digital Health applications by yourself, and to be used at the CoCoders & Trifork code-night event on September 21rd, 2022.

## Focus areas

The focus areas of the code-night event is for you to create your own Github repository where you can place your source code for your project. A personal Github repository is a great way to show others what you have created and which technologies you have tried.

The code-night will focus on Digital Health IT solutions and show you how you can take advandtage of open health APIs in your application in order to have data to work with. 

Another focus area of the event is to show how software systems, large or small, business critical or home projects, are built up. 
Usually, you will need a database to store data, a backend layer to get data from the database and forward the data to a front-end application such as a mobile app or a web page. You will also need to get the data from somewhere, and here the concept of an API comes in place. 
You will need to look at an API definition and implement code that talks to this API to get the data you want.
Last but not least, your applications need to run somewhere, and here the cloud will be introduced. The concept of having a cloud to take care of running your services is great if you want to get started quickly. You don't have to worry about how and where to run your services. In this project we will use AWS cloud as an example.

You will probably not be able to finish all areas of the challenges given at the code night, but you can continue at home and build more to your application later on, in order to be able to have a full software system running.

When the code night is over, you will hopefully have a better understanding of ...

## Prerequisites

In this code-night we will be using [SST](https://sst.dev/) which is a great framework for creating and deploying full-stack serverless applications in the cloud. You need to download and install the tools mentioned in the [getting started guide](https://docs.sst.dev/quick-start). 

You need to download and install

 - Node

And create a free-tier Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, as well an an AWS CLI locally on your computer.


## Programming language

You can use the following programming languages in your project, so choose the language of your choice and which you are most familiar with.

 - Java
 - Go
 - Typescript
 - Python
 - ...

## Open APIs for health care data

There are several open and free APIs available for getting health care data
